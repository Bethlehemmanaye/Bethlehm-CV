  There is a great story about CEO of IBM in sixty's <strong>Tom Watson Junior</strong> that goes like
   this a young executive had made some bad decision that cost the company 
   several million dollars. He was summoned to Watson's office, fully expecting
   to be fired. As he entered the office, the young executive said, "I suppose
   after that set of mistakes you will want to fire me and i completely understand It"
   . To which Watson replied. Not at all young man, we have just spent a couple
   of million dollars educating you, now we need you to put this education to work.
   <br>
   Young people need opportunity, time to prove themselves, someone who believe 
   and a good boss who follow, so give me opportunity and time if you do that 
   i appreciated.<br>
